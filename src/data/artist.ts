  artistStatement: "I create art as a meditation on nature, motherhood, and presence. Working in acrylics on plywood, ceramics, and fiber, I explore the quiet spaces where the outer world meets the inner one. My practice is rooted in stillnessâ€”shaped by time in nature, the rhythms of daily life, and the perspective of my young daughter. Each piece is an invitation to slow down, notice, and connect.",
  bio: "These peaceful meditation-informed pieces will look amazing in your Peloton room. All works are acrylic paintings on wood unless otherwise specified. Some have had a resin application, others are matte with optional resin application. As always, inquire within. ",
